# Flux Practice

Just some quick practice for setting up flux on a local k3d cluster

### Arch

- MLE - idk yet, probably just some simple LR model for Titanic or something
- Backend - (go) Simple API `/api/runModel` that simply runs a model predictions from `mle/` folder
- Frontend - (react-redux) Simple frontend that retrieves from backend API, based on this simple [CRA boilerplate](https://github.com/akiyamasho/cra-boilerplate) by yours truly

### Requirements
